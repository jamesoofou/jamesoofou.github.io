    <h1>Projecting AI Progress</h1>
    <p>(27/sep/2025)</p>
    <p>People tend to project the wrong thing when predicting AI progress. They project just whichever approach is popular at the time the prediction is being made. So they focus on upcoming bottlenecks for that particular approach and evidence of diminishing returns. So they tend to predict deceleration / a plateau in progress.</p>
    <p>People always say these things. Yet, if we zoom out, AI progress has nonetheless remained extremely rapid. AI progress is a story of breakthroughs outweighing bottlenecks. So, this more zoomed-out trend is the trend one should project. What does it look like when you project this trend?</p>
