    <p>We think this is possible but unlikely. By naive extrapolation, video generation models should have a 50% time-horizon of more than a minute by EOY 2026. This is likely not enough, given the complexity of a Minecraft speedrun. But LLM-based systems will have METR 50% time-horizons in the hundreds of hours which may enable them to play video games well, and will greatly accelerate many areas of research, potentially including video generation research.</p>
    <p>We based these video-generation time-horizon estimations on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20328">this</a> paper from Google about Veo 2 and Veo 3. The fact that results from both 2 and 3 were provided on certain timehorizny tasks meant that we could calculate the time horizon of each model which means we could calculate a time-horizon doubling-time which means that we could project video generation model time-horizon forward. Error bars are big due to only 2 data points on only 1 task, but extrapolation from few datapoints is what we do.</p>
    <p>Naive projection of Veo time-horizons:</p>
    <ul>
	<li>Veo 2 (dec 2024): 0 seconds</li>
	<li>Veo 3 (may 2024): 1 second</li>
	<li>Veo 4 (dec 2025): 8 seconds</li>
	<li>Veo 5 (may 2026): 64 seconds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is pretty similar to time-horizon for LLMs. It's about complicated problems. So a Veo-5 agent could wander around indefinitely, but not solve a really hard puzzle which would take a skilled human multiple minutes, e.g. solving an 6x6x6 Rubik's Cube (while it likely could <a href="https://manifold.markets/jim/3x3x3-rubiks-cube-solved-by-video-g?r=amlt">solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube</a>).</p>
    <p>The question then becomes <i>how hard is the hardest part of speedrunning Minecraft?</i>. If it's less than a minute or two (remember, the model gets multiple attempts at its run) in length, then the Minecraft market will likely resolve YES. Let's watch a speedrun to see.</p>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/rVs0EdiVefM?si=nTolnIOWCqGmg32Q">MINECRAFT WORLD RECORD (6:50)</a>
    <p>Well, that didn't look easy at all.</p>
    <p>So I think we'll need real acceleration in AI research from LLM advances in coding. By July 2026 we'll have model horizons which are maybe long enogh to contribute significantly to the next gen of models which will be ready by EOY. But probably not significantly enough for transformative progress in one leap. <i>Maybe</i>. It's possible AI progress will go even faster as labs figure out how to leverage model jagged frontier or as jagged frontier on 50% success time-horizon leads to superhuman tech tree exploration. But caution is wise. This is something to monitor closely (labs might share hints as they're comitted to openness and/or whistleblowers). But we have to be cautious not to get caught up in ungrounded speculation.</p>
    <h2>Broader Implications</h2>
    <p>Robotics.</p>
    <p>So we'll have a general roboticist capable of completing tasks in the real world of lengths up to a ~minute by EOY 2026, assuming naive extrapolation holds up. A general robot which can do tasks of length up to one minute can be used to automate a lot of things. We'll be getting closer to a robot that can navigate around a house, clean, do laundry, do dishes. These simple tasks as of yet unsolved by general robotics. But most jobs require solving some more difficult tasks e.g. in mining. Certain roles will be automatable though. Remember, this is assuming hyperexponentiality, but hyperexponentiality is a real possibility (and if we extend another year it becomes a certainty).</p>
    <p>So, it's like programming productivity will clearly increase massively in 2026, but it's unclear if there will be enough time for this to filter into general AI extreme advances yet by EOY or whether the 50% time horizon of ~100 hours we expect by EOY is sufficient for extremely superhuman developments (like, invent new algorithim that's 1000x more efficient so we get ASI), or is instead only sufficient for a bit of superhumanness.</p>
    <p>So, by 18/Sep/2026 where do we expect vidgen to be? since that's really important for our calls. Well, let's call it a 16 second time-horizon. This looks like certain. Let's look at which GPT had a horizon of this length. OK, we'll be GPT-3 or GPT-3.5 coded. In September. Interesting.</p>
    <p>The question is really whether exploding programmer productivity is enough to bring us to 900. 900 is a 50% increase. We can run the numbers a little. But heuristically NVDA will do well as GPU demand skyrockets, GOOG does well as provides models, META and APPLE do well as AI integration fuels new device adoption, etc., so 900 seems like a good bet. These companies drive everything, after all. But if doubling-times are longer than expected... and general progress outside of coding is less quick... no no trust the plan.</p>
    <p>Let's go a bit deeper into the stocks. And the implications.</p>
    <p>But first, let's look at <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/">Genie 3</a> automony for robotics. This should tell us some things.</p>
    <p>Wait, look at it walking around. Also remember Gemini robotics. But anyway, look at Genie simulated embodied agent walking around. At 10-60 second time-horizon and you can say "go to cooling rack, pick up bread, place in bag machine, [etc.]", which could like enable a fleet of robots managed by humans to greatly reduce human workforce. Demos of this could lead to extreme market hype.</p>
    <p>This is turning into a dumping ground for thoughts on robitics. I'll probably convert these notes into a general article on robotics in Sept' 2026.</p>
