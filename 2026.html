    <h1>One Year From Now (Part I)</h1>
    <p>(17/sep/25)</p>
    
    <p>Most programming work involves several tasks of length 2-4 hours.</p>

    <p>These tasks are a bottleneck.</p>

    <p>AI automates the easy parts of a programmer's workday. The programmer is left with the hard parts.</p>

    <p>The increase in the programmer's productivity is limited. If he wants to be twice as productive, he has to do twice as much mentally taxing programming, on top of managing the AI agents doing the more menial work.</p>

    <p>This is not revolutionary. The friction of experimental technology ensures the industry's productivity amplification factor is far below two. And most programmers do not rise to the opportunity to spend twice as much of their time doing arduous work.</p>

    <p>That's the state of AI today. And because programmer productivity is just one of several inputs for AI progress, this has a marginal effect on the rate of progress. But a step change approaches.</p>

    <p>As time-horizons extend from the ~1 hour of today to ~4 hours (projected to come with the first frontier model released after April '26) the bottleneck falls away. The programmer's workday gets more leisurely, and their productivity is no longer capped by the fact he has to do the hard parts himself. Instead, tasks can be fully-completed by AI, under the management of the programmer.</p>

    <p>With tasks being fully-completed by AI, the role of the programmer shifts. His job is to be on top of the projec: to keep on track of the project, priorities, and manage compute budget.</p>
