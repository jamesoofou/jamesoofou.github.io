    <h1>The State of OpenAI</h1>

<p>Notes on <a href="https://youtu.be/ngDCxlZcecw?si=nqjD-8Qw16sH28Xk">Sam, Jakub, and Wojciech on the future of OpenAI with audience Q&A</a>.</p>

<p>OA excited by (a) third-party apps that use AI and (b) AI accelerating science.</p>

<p>The research focus remains on scaling up deep learning.</p>

<p>The goal of this research is to fundamentally change the pace of scientific research, especially AI research. OpenAI is "a research organisation working on automating research".</p>

<p>OpenAI believes that time horizons will continue to extend rapidly, due to a combination of algorithmic innovation and scaling existing architectures. Progress is expected to come in particular from scaling in-context compute where they see "orders and orders of magnitude to go".</p>

<p>Their internal goal to "Automated AI research 2028 March" is interesting. That's METR-80 30h on an optimistic naive extrapolation. 150h METR-50. Hmm. 150h = 3 months of hard work. They probably just took METR-50 and no hyperexponentaility. Jesus.</p>

<p>"We have quite strong expectations for our next models, We expect quite rapid progress over the next couple months and a year"</p>

<p>[Paraphrase:] The way this works is we develop a lot of pieces, each a hard-won victory, and we know that when we put them together we will have something quite impressive, we're able to predict this fairly well. Part of our goal today is to say that we have a lot of those pieces" (He's talking about "a tremendously important step forward in capability")</p>
